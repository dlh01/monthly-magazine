Create a magazine in WordPress using out-of-the-box integration with Posts 2
Posts and Developers Custom Fields.

== Description ==

This plugin helps you create a monthly magazine using WordPress.

By itself, the plugin only creates a post type called Issues. For the plugin to
work as intended, you should also install [Posts 2
Posts](http://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) and [Developers Custom
Fields](http://wordpress.org/plugins/developers-custom-fields/).

Installing Posts 2 Posts allows you to define Posts as belonging to Issues
using a simple interface. By default, a link to each Post in an Issue
automatically displays when viewing an Issue. You can use a filter to add or
remove post types from the types of content eligible to be included in an
Issue.

Installing Developers Custom Fields allows you to upload a PDF copy of an Issue
--- useful for magazines that also publish in print or come with an archive. By
default, a link to the PDF displays automatically when viewing an issue. You
can use a filter to add or remove metaboxes and custom fields to the Issue edit
screen.

This plugin was created for [Religion Watch](http://www.religionwatch.com),
which publishes monthly. Despite the name, it should work relatively well for
publications on other schedules.
